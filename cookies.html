            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the website owners. Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help ensure that the advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. Some cookies are essential for the website to function properly, while others are used to enhance performance and your user experience.</p>

            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">We use cookies for several purposes, including to provide essential website functionality, improve your experience, analyze how our website is used, and serve targeted advertisements. Essential cookies are necessary for our website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. Performance cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. Functionality cookies enable enhanced features like remembering your preferences. Targeting cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners to build a profile of your interests.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">We use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them). First-party cookies are set by our website, while third-party cookies are set by a domain other than our website. We use strictly necessary cookies that are essential for you to browse our website and use its features. Performance cookies collect information about how visitors use our website. Functional cookies allow our website to remember choices you make. Advertising cookies are used to deliver ads more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">4. Essential Cookies</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information. They are typically generated when you first visit the site and are deleted when you close your browser. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">5. Performance Cookies</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">These cookies allow us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow these cookies we will not know when you have visited our site and will not be able to monitor its performance. These cookies may be set by third-party services we use such as Google Analytics. The data collected is used to improve website functionality and user experience.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">6. Functional Cookies</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages. If you do not allow these cookies then some or all of these services may not function properly. These cookies remember choices you make such as language preferences or region to provide enhanced, more personal features. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">7. Targeting Cookies</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other sites. They do not store directly personal information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you will experience less targeted advertising. These cookies track browsing habits and are used to deliver targeted (interest-based) advertising. They remember websites you visit and that information is shared with other parties such as advertisers.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">8. First-Party Cookies</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">First-party cookies are set by the website you are visiting, and they can only be read by that site. We use first-party cookies to remember your preferences and settings, to understand how you interact with our site, and to improve and personalize your browsing experience. These cookies are generally safer than third-party cookies as they can't be accessed by other websites. First-party cookies are often used for functionality like remembering items in your shopping cart or keeping you logged in as you navigate our site. We carefully control what data is collected and how it's used.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">9. Third-Party Cookies</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">Third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one you are visiting, and they are primarily used for tracking and online advertising purposes. We may allow third-party service providers to place cookies on our website to provide services such as analytics, advertising, and social media integration. These companies may use information about your visits to our and other websites to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services. You can opt out of many third-party cookies through your browser settings or by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative's opt-out page.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">10. Managing Cookies</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish - for details, see aboutcookies.org. You can delete all cookies that are already on your computer and you can set most browsers to prevent them from being placed. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit a site and some services and functionalities may not work.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-800">11. Cookie Duration</h2>
            <div class="cookie-point">
                <p class="text-gray-700">Session cookies are temporary cookies that remain on your device until you leave our website. Persistent cookies remain on your device for much longer or until you manually delete them (how long the cookie remains on your device will depend on the duration or "lifetime" of the specific cookie and your browser settings). Some cookies expire after a short time (such as session cookies), while others may remain on your device for years unless you delete them. The lifespan of each cookie depends on its purpose. We regularly review the cookies we use and their durations to ensure we're not retaining data longer than necessary.</p>

                <p class="text-gray-700">Our website may use social media plugins (like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) to enable you to easily share information with others. These plugins may set cookies that can track your browsing activity across multiple websites and build a profile of your interests. These cookies are controlled by the respective social media providers, not by us. We have no control over these cookies and how the social media providers use them. If you interact with these plugins (for example by clicking a Facebook "Like" button), the social media company may set cookies even if you don't have an account with them or aren't logged in to their service.</p>

These cookies remember that you visited our website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. While we don't share your personal information with advertisers without your consent, these cookies allow advertisers to show you ads that may be relevant to you based on your browsing patterns. You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting your Google Ads Settings.</p>
